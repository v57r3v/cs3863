1.   Poverty   traps   can   also   occur   at   a   macro   level   for   countries.      Consider   the   following table   from   Kraay   and   Mckenzie   (Journal   of   Economic   Perspectives, 2014).

(a) What   can   you   deduce   about   the   existence   of   poverty   traps   at   the   country   level from   the   above   table?
(b)   Do   you   think   that   low   average   per   capita   GDP   growth   for   countries   in   the   second quintile   implies   the   existence   of   a   poverty   trap?2. Suppose   an   employer   need   8000   units   of   work   (in   capacity   units)   to   be   performed,   and   they   can   hire   all   the   labourers   that   you   want.    Assume   that   all   income   earned   by    the   labourers   is   paid   to   them   by   the   employer   and   that   all   income   is   spent   on nutrition. The   capacity   curve   for   each   labourer   is   described   as   follows: for   all payments   up   to   £100, capacity   is   zero   and   then   begins   to   rise   by   2   units   for   every additional   pound. This   happens   until   an   income   of   £500   is   paid   out. Thereafter,   an additional   pound   paid   out   increases   capacity   by   only   1.1   units,   until   total   income   paid is   £1000. At   this   point   additiona代 写Econ 30041 Workshop 4SQL

If   employer   would   like   to   get   the   work   done   in   minimum   cost
(i)    What   would   be   the   wage   rate   they   should   pay   per   unit   of   work?
(ii)   Draw   the   labour   supply   curve.
(iii) If   there   are   100 employers   in   the   society   and   1200 workers, what   would   be the   level   of   involuntary   unemployment   rate?
3. Consider   the   following   utility   function   that   individuals   maximise
U   =   f α - p(1   - δθ)(B   -   c),                         0   < α < 1, 0 < δ < 1, θ Œ [0,1],
subject to   income
y   =   2c   + f,    where   y   =   h(1   -   θ)   +P,      P   Æ   0   .f   and   c   are   respectively   food   and   comfort   goods,   θ   is   the   attention   paid   to   home   and    p   is   the   probability   of   error   happening   at   home.   h   is   the   human   capital   individuals   are endowed   with.   Individuals   decide   on   comfort   goods   and   then   on   the   level   of   θ   .
[i]   Find   the   optimal   value   of   c.
[ii] Show that   individuals with   high   h will always choose θ=0. Assume   θ   ∈{0,1}.
[iii]   Find   the   optimal   value   of   h, where   anyone   below   it   will   choose   θ=1.
